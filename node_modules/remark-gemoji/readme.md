[**remark**][remark] plugin to turn gemoji shortcodes (`:+1:`) into emoji
(`👍`).

## Note!

This plugin is ready for the new parser in remark
([`micromark`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark),
see [`remarkjs/remark#536`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/pull/536)).
As remark no longer supports “pedantic” mode, this plugin is no longer needed.
Hence, this plugin is rewritten to be useful again: it now maps gemoji
shortcodes to emoji.
This new plugin works with old and new remark.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-gemoji
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
Thumbs up: :+1:, thumbs down: :-1:.

Families: :family_man_man_boy_boy:

Long flags: :wales:, :scotland:, :england:.
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var report = require('vfile-reporter')
var unified = require('unified')
var parse = require('remark-parse')
var gemoji = require('remark-gemoji')
var stringify = require('remark-stringify')

unified()
  .use(parse)
  .use(gemoji)
  .use(stringify)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.md'), function (err, file) {
    console.error(report(err || file))
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```text
example.md: no issues found
```

```markdown
Thumbs up: 👍, thumbs down: 👎.

Families: 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦

Long flags: 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿, 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿, 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿.
```
